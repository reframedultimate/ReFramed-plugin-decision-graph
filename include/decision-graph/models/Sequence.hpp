 * if an "aerial nair" is followed by a "landing nair", for the purpose of some
 * visualizations, these are the same thing. So they would be merged into a
 * single state "nair". Since this would make the range of states referenced in
 * the state array non-linear, so instead of storing a start and end index, an
 * array of indices is stored instead.
 * 
 * The indices will always be strictly increasing in order. A sequence should
 * never reference states out of order.
